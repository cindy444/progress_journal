1. Start to build local utlity apps 
-> full stack apps 
-> Apps w integrations and user interactions (mountain of non-technical & technical issues)
Each stage requires us to mastered it before moving on to the next stage 

2. A Project Idea should be published, deployed, 
and continuously improved it over time. 
A smooth experience for users/employers/recruiters to use your MVP product. 
Don't create a project only some of the functionalities work and others don't. 

3. Depth Over Breath
a. Build apps that have a refined user experience 
b. Evolve any small app idea into sth complex 
c. "Whenever you learn sth, try to built it in a way that it just always works, even the user throws sth unexpected at it"

Ask Yourself: 

1. Am I passionate about solving this problem? 

2. How are you able to solve this simple problem with a much higher level of quality 

_
Here are some of the specific gaps Alex looks out for in existing product: 

1) Missing crucial features: 
What are the features/things that the users find missing when using the app?  

2) Unintuitive Design:
Can the users pick it up and know how to use it? Anything they find hard to understand?

3) Inefficiency: 
Is your product saving time? Is it fast for users to get what they want in a short period of time?

4) Ugly UI: 
Is the design pleasant to look at for the users? is your UI up to date?

5) Straight up bugginess: 
Have you done your testing thoroughly for your app? stress test them? go down all the flows, ie, error flows?
