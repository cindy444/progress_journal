## How To Ace Your Big Tech Interview: Data Structures & Algorithms w/ Alex Chiou & Rahul Pandey 

### The Mental Game
- You need have a proper mindset and stay mentally healthy throughout the learning and interviewing process 

- Progress Is Exponential 
    - You may feel you are being defeated when you first start learning Leetcode 
    - It is completely normal when you may take a long period of time to fully understand DSA 
    - It is just like running a Marathon 
    - There is a methodology that you would like to learn to slowly understand DSA 
    - The system is more important (like how you do everyday to slowly get you to the ultimate goal)

- Staying Motivated 
    - DSA Prep = Insane ROI (return of investment), especially for Big Tech 
    - Couple months -> 10s of thousands of $ increase 
    - Alex studied everyday for about 3 months and he would be able to accomplish higher compensation 
    - Learn from the best of the best 
    - Job Searching becomes trivial so you can focus on more creative product developments and work with more creative works - in general, more choices and more learning!!! 

- Find a Buddy 
    - Social accountability is powerful 
    - Closer to real experience 

- Other Tips
    - Turn it into a habit 
    - In your DSA journey, have at least 30m - 1h just commit to do problems (Leetcode, etc.)
    - Take frequent breaks (since you are running a marathon in your DSA journey, you need to keep doing it)
    - Don't cram! (Don't wait until the last minute, or put a lot of information into your mind in a short period of time) - it is not worth it! 
    - Study a lot in order to pass DSA 
    - Care a little - Don't worry about failing, because it does not help with your mental health. Have the mentality to face failure, and then start another one with an even more exciting mental state. **Rejection is always a Redirection in life!** 
    - Mental flexivility is crucial
    - **Input matters more than the output** - you can control what you can put in, but you cannot control the outcome if you pass or fail an interview. 

### Preparation 

- Tools 
    - Leetcode (**Buy Premium!** around $35 dollars/month)
        - Phone Screen: Easy + Medium 
        - Onside: Medium + Hard 
        - This is the standard in the industry!!
        - Definitely use it for your daily learning 
    - Glassdoor 
        - interview data (the more data you know, the better!)
        - It is actually really useful 
        - You can be more prepared with what kind of questions companies ask 
    - Cracking the Technical Interview 
        - Going through this book is really good for the preparation 
    - Programming language 
        - Concise ones like Python are preferred 
        - Avoid verbose ones like C 
        - Stick with a language that the interviewers are familiar with 

- Learning The Material 
    - **Learn patterns**, not code 
        - If you have not seen the problem before, look for the pattern in the problem to see if you can try to solve it
        - Don't waste time memorize everything, memorize the pattern 
    - Extensively comment your solutions 
        - write down how you did or your approach 
    - Use tiered system to "give up" 
        - Dont just look at the answer and give up 
        - **Be able to turn 1 liners into code**
        - For example: "Look for the difference and use a HashSet" -- shows an essense of the problem 

- Communication 
    - Crucial for big companies 
        - You need to be able to communicate what you learned or do well so you can work with other co-workers 
    - Not only about getting the right answer 
        - How you approach the problem and how you are able to communicate through problem? -- this is more crucial 
    - 5 mins+ of silence = Bad 
    - Collaborate with Your Interviewer 
        - Don't code in silence - speak out your thought 
        - Adaptability & Flexibility 

- Process 
    - Clarify the problem (around 5 mins)
        - Let's make sure you fully understand the problem 
        - Before you start, confirm with the interviewer regarding to the runtime and complexity 
        - Architectural Design interview has no coding involved - you basically need to constanly ask questions
        - Before you start, keep an eye on the clock! 
    - Explain overall approach 
        - Relative simple solution and code out pretty quickly 
        - Optimal solution: if you cannot code it out and you think there is way to make the code optimal, then explain your thought process rather than coding it out. If time proceeds, then you can try the optimal approach. 
    - Code Solution 
        - How you approach is important! 
    - Analyze Solution
        - Review the codes again to see whether the approach is a right way to do. 
    - Rahul suggestion: if time is limited, you dont need to write out the whole function, you can just say assume this function works - then this is what happens next. 

### Q&A

- Big Tech - Referral is key! 

- Temporary Job - would that job helps you in your career? - you want to be in a company with good mentorship so you can have feedback to help you succeed as an engineer - please dont stay in this company anymore if you cannot learn anything! 

- If you need a job now, then it is crucial to get into leetcode and prepare for getting the job 

- The power of side projects - it can definitely accelerate your career 

- It is also depends on the company, you might need to focus on certain DSA topics specifically or you may encounter certain topic more in the interview. 

- Before you go into a Big Tech company, take 30 mins of your time to work with the Recruiter to get yourself prepare before the interview. Make sure you have everything set up and prepared. 
    
### More Notes From Alex

Hey everyone, thanks so much for your support for the earlier session today about interviewing for Big Tech, specially on the DSA portion. As usual, here's a thorough session recap for those who missed it or just want something for your notes.

#### The Mental Game

Progress with DSA will be exponential. You will struggle in the beginning for a long time. You will eventually hit an inflection point where you start recognizing patterns and finally feel like you’re making real progress. Hang in there.

Sometimes it’s not clear what steps you need to take to achieve a goal. For example, I used to have a goal of making at least one code change in a project everyday (Github commit streak). There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, but if the higher-level objective is to build a startup, a goal of writing code everyday is unlikely to be the best measure of progress.

Thankfully, there are many examples where a specific and measurable goal is perfectly aligned with the longer term. Running a marathon is the prime example; running has a purity where the short term goals clearly build up to longer term goals. The path to success is as simple as sticking to the plan. There’s no luck (or thinking) involved, just an indomitable will combined with a deep work ethic.

Take breaks! As mentioned before, interviewing is exhausting; if all you do is grind and cram, your mental state will not be good enough for the interview. Alex’s rule of thumb: ~30 minute break for every 2 hours of work.

Find an interview buddy if you can. It’s so helpful having some semblance of something simulating the real thing vs. staying purely in the realm of study. Social accountability is also extremely powerful.

To further stay motivated, remember that mastering DSA for a Big Tech interview is one of the highest ROI activities any human being can do:

- A couple months of effort -> Tens of thousands of $ in increased compensation, maybe even $100k+
- After working for Big Tech, you will never have to apply online or cold message ever again. Every company will come to you.
- You learn from the absolute best working for Big Tech. Your growth will be put into hyperdrive.
- Turn it into a habit like exercise. DSA is not meant to be done in giant bursts.
- Do not cram! Relax before the interview instead. It is crucial that your mental state is nimble going into DSA rounds. You will likely get a problem you haven’t seen before.
- Don’t view the opportunity as make or break. Treat it as much as any other day; Alex views all his interviews as just a chance to chat with some cool tech people. The less you care about the interview, the less stressed out you are. It’s okay if you will; there will be more chances.

#### Preparation

Just buy Leetcode Premium - We all love to save money, but Leetcode Premium is a no brainer if you are interviewing with any big company. Even if it only increases your chances of getting an offer by 5%, that’s a 5% higher chance for a job paying 100k+.
What to expect:

- Phone screen: Leetcode easy and medium
- Onsite: Leetcode medium and hard
- Glassdoor is an extremely valuable resource with Big Tech as its usefulness scales with company size. If you see a question that’s been recorded twice for your position, know how to solve it.
- If possible, use a compact, efficient language like Python/JavaScript since time control is crucial during DSA rounds. Avoid very verbose languages like C/C++.
- You are looking to learn patterns, not individual solutions. 80%+ of DSA problems fall within ~15 different core patterns. Don’t try to memorize individual solutions for everything; that is not scalable. You will also have to memorize some solutions for the really tricky hards; if you’re memorizing for easy/medium as well, you will quickly run out of brain space.
- Extensively write comments on the problems you solve; in particular, try to capture the key to the problem (e.g. sort the list and then use sliding window). You want to be able to convert keys to problems into all the code needed for the solution vs. remembering the code itself.

#### Communication

- The bigger the company, the more soft skills are valued. In particular, great communication skills are crucial.
With Big Tech, it isn’t only about the right answer. It’s also about how you got to that answer (i.e. how well did you communicate with the interviewer).
- Interview process at Big Tech is streamlined and efficient. Interviewer is trained to get as much good signal from the candidate as possible. This means they want to collaborate with you. 
- Relationship is bidirectional (you work together with interviewer) instead of unidirectional (you quietly solve the problem on your own and are then judged afterwards)
Listen carefully to what the interviewer says. They may be trying to help you, especially when you have tunnel vision.
5 min+ of silence = bad. Don’t just write code in silence, especially as the language you’re using may not be the primary language of the interviewer.

#### Process

- Ask questions to clarify the scope of the problem
- Explain your overall approach to the problem
Done is better than perfect - You will often not get the optimal solution off the bat. It’s better to have a working sub-optimal solution vs. a half-finished “optimal” solution that doesn’t even compile yet
- If you don’t get any red flags from the interviewer, proceed
- Start writing code
- Solve for the core of the problem first, which is often the hardest part
- Many candidates tackle the trivial portions first (e.g. write a utility method to convert an array of chars into a string), because that’s where they’re comfortable. These portions often aren’t even required by the interviewer and give low signal.
Adding on to the above point, ask if you can “hand-wave” pieces away. Utility functions can often be saved from this. Every saved minute counts!
- Watch out for tunnel vision! Check every 5 minutes to see if the path you’re going down doesn’t feel right (you just can’t seem to get it to work). If you’re going to pivot, do it ASAP!
Solution
- Understand where your solution’s shortcomings are, whether it’s in performance or code structure
- Don’t forget about space complexity
Understand how to come up with good test cases (i.e. extreme/wonky inputs)

## Alex & Rahul Q&A 08/04/21

```
1. For early in career folks, should learning be done breath-wise or depth-wise?
2. How do you prepare a perfect portfolio to get recruiters to come find you?
3. How do you get FAANG interviews?
4. How do you balance your time between active office projects vs. self learning?
5. What are your strategies for stopping procrastination?

```

### 1. For early in career folks, should learning be done breath-wise or depth-wise?

- Depth-wise is more important for early career folks, but...
- If you have not found anything that you are passionate about yet, then you would like to try many things as you can. 
- Start to convert from breath-wise to depth-wise 
- In order to be a technical efficient in one tech stack, you cannot always switch around. 
- All tech stacks are basically the similar or the same 
- The Fundamentals are crucial (DSA)
- Teacher (Rahul's perspective)
    - Do not fix the problem for the students 
    - Where are they in their learning journey and why they are stucked? 
    - Suggest a Roadmap to possibly able to solve the problem 
- Technology is changing so rapidly. The way you build things 5 years ago and what you use to build in the most recent years are constantly changing 
- You have to go deep in one area and then you can start pick up in other areas rapidly 

### 2. How do you prepare a perfect portfolio to get recruiters to come find you?

- Invest in Linkedin that recruiters are constantly on 
- Side projects are really powerful 
- Portfolio means that you would like to showcase some of your personal projects 
- Linkedin Quiz is not really essential 

### 3. How do you get FAANG interviews?

- Netflix only hires senior engineers 
- Big tech is extremely competitive 
- They are really good at what the industry is doing 
- Breaking into the big tech as a junior engineer (less than 2 years of experience) is close to impossible 
- The supply of junior software engineer is really high and extremely high 
- The demand is also high in Big Tech on senior software engineer 
- It is really costy if the junior software engineer breaks certain thing, it would be hard to maintain over time 
- Once you have 5 years of experience, big tech companies are starting to come to you. 
- Patience -- Get more experience and get ready for the FAANG interview 

If you are thinking to get into FAANG in the future, here are how you could start preparing for it: 
- Side Projects 
    - At least 50,000-100,000 users 
- Open Source Contribution 
    - Being involve in the open source community 
    - if you are going down this route, you have clone the github repo, or fork it and try to work on it 
- Don't apply online for big tech (networking becomes so crucial)
    - 1. Recruiters
        - Help you to get into the door  
        - Perspective: "I want to get the best of the best to go to do the interview and who are likely to pass the interview!" 
        - This is how they are reaching out to people to introduce them to the Big Tech Interview 
        - They are looking for if you have an amazing side projects, prior experience! 
    - 2. Referrals 
        - Get connected with individuals in the FAANG

### 4. How do you balance your time between active office projects vs. self learning?
- The things I learn at work can also apply to your self learning 
- You cannot just consume information, you need to apply what you have learned, ie, explain to someone, use it for your side project, and write a blog post to explain what you learn

- **How importance is this career to you?**
    - extremely high 

- **How importance is your career to the company you are working for?** 
    - pretty low

- You have to be careful with the company you work for. 

- You cannot rely on the company to take care of you. 

- **You need to invest in self-learning outside of work. In order to build the career that you want.** 

- Turning your self-learning into something you enjoy. Spent your free time on something you find enjoy doing outside of work, especially your side projects 
    - To Alex: doing all the side projects are fun to do and they are like entertainment 

- **How to make your self-learning more enjoyable?**

- That does not mean you have to do this all alone. You can always find a buddy to work on it together. 

### 5. What are your strategies for stopping procrastination?

- Time management: how to better manage my time to avoid procrastination? 

- Biggest mistake: they are planning too much to do in a certain period of time 

- Solution: Take 1 or 2 things that you are **really confident** that you are able to accomplish that day 

- Problem Example: I want to redesign website 

- Solution: I am going to redesign a specific section and update a particular part only using this bootstrap 

- You have to be really clear in what you want to do. 

- You have to have a system and YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN. 

- Do a weekly or monthly reflection ~ what are you spending your time on? Are you able to get anything done? 
    - Here are 3 things that I think I did well
    - Here are 3 things that I need to improve 

- CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WITH NO DISTRACTIONS 
    - Put your phone away from arm reach 
    - Have a dedicate time to focus on work 
    - Create a system that you trust and you follow 

- BREAKING THINGS DOWN 
    - IF you have a bunch of deadlines, your brain will kick in at these milestones and make progress 

- ADD SOCIAL PRESSURE 
    - Find a study buddy 
        - You do not want to let the other person down since they are watching out for you 

- IF YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU LOVE, YOU DONT REALLY FEEL LIKE IT IS WORK! 

### IT IS THE NUMBER GAME!
- Just apply to as many as you could 

### Strong Linkedin Profile 

- A Good Headshot 
- Add Projects and Good descriptions of how they work 

### Built apps on Google Play - How to promote it? 

- Look at the top apps and then mimic their methods 
- Alex is the top Android developer!!! 

### Avoid Take Home Assignment from Interview 
- It can be a waste of time and you do not get any feedback 
- So be strategic about it if you are applying to a company that you are not passionate about 

### Reflect if you have applied to more than 100 jobs and still have not heard back or got rejected 
- You might have to update your profile or add a side project that allows you to stand out from others

## How To Write A Stellar Tech Resume That Gets You More Job Opportunities - August 28, 2021

#### Intro 
- The **Recruiter** is the one who is reading your resume 
    - They are the one who are **non-technical**
    - Spends an average of **7.4 seconds**

- You must **stand-out** 
    - Competing with dozens/hundreds of applicants 
    - Basic proficiency isn't enough now 
        - The supply for junior jobs are not high 
        - Because people can learn fast from the resources out there 
        - When going through the ATS system:
            - How to make it into the YES pile 
            - The key is not to be too artistic and creative on a resume 
        
- It is crucial to know **how to fish** than how many fishes we can catch

#### Be Ruthlessly Concise
- 1 page per 5 years of experience max 
- Trim the fat
    - is it an impactful statement? 
- Be careful of what you claim as a skill 
    - are you really familiar with the skill you listed on your resume? 
- Compress or remove old experience 
    - things got outdated really fast 
    - so you basically need to be going with the trend 
- Keep an eye on spacing 
- When you put Languages you know on your resume, less is more: 
    - Languages: JavaScript, React  
    - If you put that language there, you must be sure that you know the language and know it well, and that you are familiar with!! 
    - Would you be able to have in depth conversation regarding to that programming language in the interview?
    - It would waste space and it is not a skill that you are familiar with yet -- think about this!!

#### Keep it Boring And Simple 
- Keep the formatting simple: 
    - 1 column is best, 2 columns max 
    - 1 column (the reader do not need to think, they know to read from top to bottom)
    - 2 columns would make the reader to think 
- Have sections with dividers 
    - readability is crucial
    - be careful with margins 
- Avoid paragraphs by breaking into bullet points 
    - Bullet points -- make things more easy to read 
- Be strategic with your use of bolding/color coding 
    - your resume is like your muscle 
    - dont overuse bolding/color coding 
    - maybe it is best sometimes not to use it 
- Avoid wonky formats 
    - don't use pie charts, or too many special designs
- Creativity does not replace proficiency! 
    - The purpose of the resume is whether you can drive impact in my company 
    - so it does not matter how good it looks, what matter is if I could see "impact" from the resume 
- Alex resume 
    - bold only the company name and date, italics the role at the company, 2 bullets point max for each experience or projects

#### Spelling And Grammar Matter 
- Easiest way for your resume to get thrown out
- Attention to detail is a good hiring signal 
- **You have to take the time to make a good resume** - since we are looking to perform on the stage, we need to polish our skills and take the time to train before you can perform on that specific important date. It is the same thing for the resume. Your resume only get **7 seconds** to perform in front of your recruiters, so think about how you would be able to showcase the most during that time. 
- Many free tools to help here - grammarly - can use to check your grammar 
- Leverage community to help you out with your resume
    - Ask others to help you to review your resume 

#### Show, Don't Tell 
- Most common mistake people make is telling too much in resume 
    - Please do not include a Personal Statement at the beginning - it is just a waste of space 
    - You can show people how good you are by the product you produced!!! ie, 120,000 users subscribed, etc.
    - No need to show metrics of your skills - it is meaningless, concise and straightforward are best, **only show metrics from your project or work experience -- those are what matters!!!** 
- Everyone can say that they're good 
- Show the impact 
    - Use strong verbs: implemented, integrated, piloted, optimized, refactored 
    - Accomplished [x], measured by [Y], by doing [Z]
- Make it accessible 
    - Empathy for the audience (recruiter)
    - You need to descibe the impact you make even someone who is not an expert or technical can still understand what you wrote 
- Publish, publish, publish!
    - You have to create your own experience by publishing it 
        - Github (readme) 
            - Readme is extremely crucial to showcase to recruiters with a deployed link!!! 
        - deployed site 
        - track the result and output (like to see how many users)
    - It is crucial to remember that Recruiter do not know how to read your codes, but they can try out what you have done. 
    - You need to have it deliverable 
    - It needs to be **functional**
- Using scale or numbers to showcase your accomplishments in the role which you work for OR the project you have worked on 
- You can add technologies used for each project/each job experience at the company 
- Your big Skill section should only include the language that you are confident about. The rest of the technology used, you can showcase on each project you did OR on your work experience 
- Avoid too much personal information - don't want to create biases 
- Don't need to include references in your resume 

#### What does the market thinks about Software Engineer? 
- The point of being an engineer is to **make an impact with your codes**! Like the impact you make with what you code!! 

#### Most Pracitcal --> Least Practical 
- Goal: Show that you can ship production code 
- Preferred order: 
    - Work experience - Actual shipping 
    - Personal projects - Shipping but more informal 
    - Education - Almost never shipping 
- Can this person add more impact to the company? 

#### Working with the ATS
- ATS = Applicant Tracking System 
    - resume will be processed through the system and filter out applicants 
- Have core tech terms 
- Keep formatting simple 
- **Word Doc Format** is the safest 
- Don't over-optimize here! 
    - Remember to optimize your resume for human other than just for the ATS

#### How to Get More "Meat" For Your Resume 
- Resume optimization is the "dressing" around your "core" (actual accomplishments)
- Weak core --> Hard to find jobs 
- Side projects can supercharge your core!! 

#### Anouncement! 
- Let's build better personal software projects, together. 
- Focus on projects you've built yourself (not part of a company or group project)
- These projects are a primary lever to advance your career in tech, especially as a junior engineer! 
- ImberApp.com 

#### Q&A
- Web App Metric - how to meaure the impact of your web app? 
    - Google Analystics - is a good metric to measure web 
    - with many users are a great way to showcase your impact 

- How to start learning Tech?

## How to Build And Grow Tech Products To 500+ Users For Free - Alex & Rahul - on 10/02/2021

#### HOW TO BUILD YOUR PRODUCT

#### Why you should always be building? 
- Just as good as work experience if you get users
- When you are building usable experience, you are building more business values than work experience 
- Create your own work experience for users to use 
- Best non-professional learning by building projects compared to watching tutorials or reading, the ACTUAL LEARNING is from BUILDING!! 
- Putting yourself to the world to help others around the world 
- Always building personal projects on a side can help you unlock your career path (or even more career paths)
- The more you put yourself out there, you would be able to connect with those who care about your path! 
- Fun and Fulfilling!! (huge privilege that we are able to do this!!)
- The idea of continuous improvement to slowly get to your goal. The journey to pursuit the goal becomes more meaningful than the destination! 
- Alex - transfer from the fullstack engineer to an Android engineer by using his own side project 
- Actually build high production code in your own side project - they are the biggest proof of your own knowledge and progress 
- Anything you learn from your side project can always be applied to your day job! 

#### Just 1 thing (that you can focus to build in your side project)
- Solve specific problem with high focus 
- Have as **few features** as possible 
- Depth over Breadth 
- Work backwards and then cut aggressively 
    - Cut any extra features and make it as focus as possible 
- Features you might not need (depends on what you are trying to develop!)
    - Login/sign up accounts (ie, data compliance issue, password flow, uniqueness of username, etc.)
    - your entire server-side 
    - the crazy marketplace you're building 
        - Marketplace product =  ie, Facebook (you need to have a lot of users already using the products)
- Level 1 (things you do on your phone), Level 2 (fullstack + publish), Level 3 (operational problems)
- Feedback reception is crucial! ~ the ambition is great but you need to start with something simple - break it down into different phases! - Write down all these phases can help you to know what step you need to take next 
- **The easiest way to get to the finish line is to move the finish line closer to you!!**
- Once you hit to the **PUBLISH** line, then you can start to go a little more advanced with your application like Level 2 and 3.

#### HOW TO GROW YOUR PRODUCT 

#### Eat your own Dogfood 
- Most important user is YOU
- Necessary to build user empathy
- Need this to fix initial clunkiness 
- Fill in the gaps as you get initial users 
- When you are using it yourself, you will know what you need to do to improve your app 
- From the hiring perspective, there is a lot of values in this! - You are building an application to help yourself or others to accomplish a goal or solve a problem
- People are interested in people who have interests! - this helps you to find a job and a mentor! 

#### Feedback is a Gift 
- It's free product managmeent 
- Some of the **best reviews are the negative ones**
- Let initial users craft roadmap 
- Respond to every review in the beginning 
    - Alex responds to first 1,000 
    - Make time spent proportional 
        - 5 stars - thank you and glad you have a good experience 
        - 1 star - can ask them if they can leave more feedback
        - People who respond a lot and invest their time in their response, put in slightly more time in responding back the user who invest their time using and reviewing your app
        - Negative ones - thank you for the feedback and I will improve the application and once it is updated, I will keep you updated 
    - humans like to **interact** with another humans 
- When you are building your app, you are a product manager, UI/UX designer, software developer, business initiative, and researcher
- Always go for Quality and in return you will get more Feedback from the users 

#### Understand SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
- Include **popular terms relevant to your product in its title/description**: Congratulations, you're now an SEO master!
- Low hanging fruit with massive gains 
- Put yourself in user's shoes looking for a product 
- Find your competition via these terms 
- Learn from competition 
    - learn more your competitor - copy any base features that you like to your app - and create your own app by solving the edge cases that your competitors dont do! 
- **YOU NEED TO KEEP UPDATING YOUR PRODUCT!!! ACTIVELY IMPROVING IT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME!!!**
- SEO in web can more challenging than SEO in Google/iOS App stores - since there are more websites than mobile applications 

#### Keep Iterating and Improving 
- Marathon, not a sprint
    - Doing the same thing continuously over a period of time 
- Version 1 will not explode on its own 
    - you will have to keep updating it overtime 
- **Commit to at least 15+ updates across 2+ months** 
    - This should apply to before or after you publish your web or mobile applications!!! 
- For mobile stores, updates help with ranking 
- Random Name Picker 
    - Was on single-digit to 0 downloads per day for around 3 months
    - After hitting stride, quickly went from 10 -> 25 -> 50 -> 100 -> 200 -> 400 installs per day 
- Same thing for DSA 
    - **Commit First Regarding What the Outcome is**
    - CFOL - **Commit First Outcome Last**!

## How To Learn Quickly In Tech? - Alex & Rahul - 10/16/21 

#### Asking Questions 
- In order to learn quickly, DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS 
- People are afraid of how they are perceived based on the questions they ask 
- There is no dumb or stupid question, every question is a cry to understand the world!! 
- Question quantity is a good metric for onboarding 
- Asking > Being Stuck ~~ asking more is better than being stuck 
- When you are stuck for more than 15 mins --> Then ask the questions!!! 
    - If there is no progress make, then it is better to ask so you can be more productive 
    - Document: 
        - What you are trying to do? 
        - What you have tired to resolve the issue? 
- Creating resource for others when you keep asking questions in the public space 
- Builds social capital if done properly 
- There is a difference between high effort and low effort questions!! 

#### Question Quality 
- Questions are an exchange of time 
- Ideal question interaction is equal 
- Have empathy for the people answering 
    - putting yourself in the other shoes 
    - How you are able to help others to save their time when they are answering your questions? 
    - **Avoid leading "hi"** 
        - ie, "Hello", "Hi", "How are you?"
        - instead embeded the questions you would like to ask directly (the main context!)
    - **Pass the "1st round Google" test**
        - Have you googled for you problem? and scan through the result? 
        - At a bare minimum, you have to put in the effort to google for the answer first 
    - **Explain what you have tried**
        - Can you unblock your problem on your own? if not, reach out for help! 
    - **Attach Context**
        - Make sure you have enough information in your questions so others are able to know exactly what your problem is, what you have tried, and what you are stucked? 
        - Context can include: what stack you are using? and what domain is this question related to? ~ provide just enough so the people to know the exact problem you encountered 
    - **Be Nice And Appreciative!** 
        - Always say thank you to those who spent times to help you out!!! 

**Bad Question Example**

"I am trying to load an image in my Android app, and it shows up blank. Any ideas on what's going on here?"

**Good Question Example**

"I am trying to load the following image resource into an ImageView within a single-page activity using the Picasso library. The image is from this URL: tinyurl.com/9xu67

My app has the Internet permission ...

I tried X, Y, and Z from ...

Here are more context: 
- Github code: ...
- Screenshot: ...

"

#### Before you ask the question, ask yourself... 
- What would they be responding to me if I ask this question?? 
- What would be the next question they ask? 

#### Learn By Doing 
- Cost of writing (and rewriting) software is low 
- Best way to learn a new technology is to start tinkering 
- Don't waste time on the structured preparation: 
    - Waiting for a certificate/diploma 
    - Reading (excessive) documentation 
- Open up a console and start writing the codes since you will retain more when you are actually writing the codes ~ START WRITING CODES IS THE KEY TO LEARN
- Share what you know and write down what you have learned, and published this so you can benefit other people 
    - This is the best way for you to fully retain the information 
    - LEARN WITH OTHERS 
- How to learn a new language? 
    - start really small 
    - break things, delete lines of codes, and what happens? 
    - start to learn alone is hard, work together with others, and receiving feedback from others can help you learn fast in every new programming language 

#### Feedback is a Gift 
- Processing Feedback (constructive feedback)
    - Don't be defensive and accept them with open arms! 
    - Take them and apply immediately!!! 
    - The giver may feel weird too - Thank them! (put yourself in their shoes - they also feel the same way when giving the feedback!)
    - Write it down 
        - since tech is moving by or on so fast, it is best to write them down so you can refer back whenever you needed 
    - Convert it into action items 
        - Turn the feedback into the action items so you can implement them asap!!!
    - If the feedback is not constructive:
        - Talk to their superior 
        - Have a crucial conversation
        - If the feeback is not impactful, either have vulnerable conversation with the manager OR leave the company and find another team that values you! 

#### Getting Feedback 
- Embrace being the "dumbest person in the room" 
    - Embrace the struggle and embrace not knowing everything 
- Be proactive! 
    - "If this could be better, please let me know!"
- Ask for recurring feedback from managers 
    - For around 2-3 weeks, ask for the feedback from the managers - What have I done well? What can I do better? 
    - Make this clear with your manager 
- Set the stage in 1:1 setting 
    - To proactively ask for feedback 
    - It should be a difficult situation (no wasting time for both you and the manager)
        - What have I done? 
        - What should I start doing? 
        - What should I stop doing? 
- Preemptively surface areas of improvement 
    - You should be your own hardest critic 
    - Self-observing and Self-reflection 
    - This can be done whenever you are doing Pull Request, leave your comment and ask for feedback to know what you could have done better. 

#### Understanding Tech As Legos 
- Combine legos to create useful combinations 
- Legos = tech components, combination = product 
- Governing principles: 
    - Get lots of legos 
    - Get high-quality legos 
    - Get "core", high-demand legos 

#### Getting A High-Quality Lego (Onboarding Example)

These are NOT simply the below feature (shallow): 
- email input
- password input 
- submit button which stores inputs on the server 

These are WHAT ACTUALLY NEEDED in a quality feature (depth):
- Email input with real-time validation 
- Password input that enforces complexity constraints 
- Confirm password field 
- "Show Passowrd" toggle so users can be sure they didn't typo 
- "Forget Password" flow
- Attempt throttling on both onboarding submission and forgot password flow to prevent spam and brute-force hacking 
- Secure passward hashing 
- Error messages (email already used, network failure, etc.)

#### Let's look for the CORE legos!! Which of the following are considered as CORE lego in tech project? 
**YES** - spend more time doing this would be worth it!  (business and user values)
**NO** - spend more time doing this would not be that worth it! 

- Onboarding flow (sign-up/login) - YES (most apps nowadays really need this to retain their users overtime - business value)
- Showing a list of items - YES (most apps have a list somewhere - high chance you would be asked regarding this in an interview)

- Playing videos - NO 
- Dynamic map view that shows the location of a person or object in real-time - NO 

#### Let's Create a Learning Roadmap! 
- You NEED TO Forge your own path (you need find your own path being a software engineer)
- Structure is your enemy 
    - Having too many structures in tech can become your enemy (like following the traditional path)
- Tech moves incredibly fast 
- Highest levels of tech are "controlled chaos"
    - If you want to work in tech field and go up the ladder, you have to able to embrace all the chaos 
- Learn to embrace and be comfortable within unknowns 
- Work backwards from a big North Star, not forward following predefined steps 

#### What to avoid in the structure way of learning? 
- Tutorials (you can start this off, but make something meaningful where help others to learn)
- Certifications 
- Online Quizzes 
- Competitive Programming 
- Exercises where you follow someone's exact path 

#### So what should you do instead? 
- How do you forge yoru won path, especially outside of work? 
    - ImberApp.com 
    - The ultimate way to go off the beaten path - **Create an impactful personal software project**
    - Imber is a learning community to empower you to do just that

#### Takeaways 
1. Effective Question Asking 
2. Learn By Doing 
3. Feedback is a Gift 
4. The Lego Model
5. Building a powerful learning roadmap! 

#### Q&A 
- **How to build amazing projects that attract Recruiters (who do not know the technology)? How to deliver the message better to the recruiter?** 
    - To bypass recruiters is REFERAL through networking!! 

- **Competitive Programming vs Hackathon is the best way to learn?** 
    - Hackathon has higher value than competitive programming
    - Hackathon is an amazing way to do networking! 
    - You want to surround with people with positive energy at work as well! 
    - Competitive programming is not building a product, it is like DSA, so it helps you to familiarize with programming 
    - If compared with Hackathon or building a product with value, then competitive programming does not really give that much of value and hiring advantage. 
    - Competitive programming would be able to helpful for technical interview but not in the long run 

- **Who should ask for feedback in a team of 7-8 (co-workers)?**
    - Have at least 4-5 peers minimum to get their feedback on your performance 
    - Leverage the opportunity and ask the manager for advise to see who you could reach out in the team for feedback 
    - Target the co-workers who are more involved in the project to get their feedback 
    - Tryin to find the seniors in the team for advise 

- **Job posting that requires certain level of experience, should I still apply?**
    - If they require 2-3 years of experience, subtract it by 2 years
    - If you meet 100% of the requirement, you are over-qualify for the job 
    - Even you are not 100% qualified for the job (60-70%), you should still apply for the job! 
    - Job description is a lie!!! ~ Rahul 

- **Look at the people around you to see who you would like to work with and the language they are using!**

- **If you have an idea, then learn and pick a platform to accomplish the goal/turn the idea into reality**

- **How to evaluate if you are in the right working environment?**
    - Who you are surrounding yourself with? 
    - Are you improving overtime? 
    - You want to put yourself in a situation that you can always do that 
    - If your manager or team is willing give you new challenge to work on, then lucky you, you finally find a great team to be in!!! 

- **Open-Source Project**
    - Find an **active** and more advanced project where there are more engineers involved 
    - There is a barrier to entry for Open-Source projects that increases your value in being hired 
    - If you are writing valuable and submitting a pull request for review, this is a really valuable experience you can have!


## How to Ace your Big Tech Interview - System Design? - Alex & Rahul 11/06/21

#### What is System Design? 
- Open-ended design challenges, testing your ability to design + build software systems both on intervews and day job 
- Also tests: 
    - Communication 
        - How do you talk in the interview?
        - Personality
    - Ability to handle ambiguity
    - Understand how components fit together 
        - How would the application talks to other systems? 
    - Long-term thinking 
        - What assumptions you are making? 
        - Edge cases? 
        - Proactively communicate with the interviewer 

#### Who Does It Apply To? 
- Experienced engineer (2+ year of experience) interviews will have at least 1 system design round 
- Usually not required for junior engineer interviews, but depends on the company
- Anybody trying to grow to a senior engineer 
- This is what you are going to be doing day-to-day, so this is a really important value you can provide to the company and to your own product that you are designing 

#### Preparation 
- Tools: 
    - Read Engineering Blogs of the company you are applying to 
        - Understand the product and interesting tech challenges for that company 
        - You can able to know how does the team works within the company 
        - What do they think about tradeoffs? What is more important to them? 
    - Understand the tradeoffs when using services like Firebase or SQL 
    - Write down your thoughts are really valuable since you are able to communicate with yourself during the interview - write down what you learned and how would it be applying to the product that company is designing 
    - Learn how popular apps work at a high level (Instagram, Twitter, Youtube)
        - Know how these apps are created and developed 
        - How they stored, managed and maintained overtime 
    - Build serious side projects 
        - Organic product at scale 
        - Clone a popular app without any tutorials 
            - But for certain features, you can also read some more online and research to see how others do the specific features, but if none of those work, design your own and experiment with the thought you have 
            - If you are able to clone a product to see how you can do it and give it a try!!! 
            - BUT STILL, always try building it out from scratch to see how it goes!!! 
            - This is an overtime idea that means you need several months in order to build it!
            - For those who have interivew in the next week or so, you can try to think of a mini-project app idea, and then see how you would approach the problem in a limited amount of time OR you can also focus on reading more blogs of the company (if any) to learn more about them!

- Focus less on mechanics and more on tradeoffs 
    - ie, "We will use MongoDB for the database instead of MySQL" - why this is a better choice? and what is the tradeoffs for the decision? 

- Learning The Material 
    - YouTube Channel - System Design Interview 
    - Do Mock Interviews!!
    - Understand How products work end to end (think of the modern apps that people are using nowadays):
        - Front-End 
        - API layers (JSON REST)
        - Database (Schema Definition)
        - Possible Libraries 
        - How the connection between the Frontend, APIs, and Database 
        - Possible Models to use (MVC - Model, View, Controller)

- Interview Prep Fundamentals 
    - Chill out! 
    - Takes your time!! 
    - Take frequent study breaks!! ~ do 1 hour a day can be better and more productive 
    - **Study a lot, care a little**
        - You have to have flexible mindset 
        - Do not put any weight on yourself when you go into the interview 
        - If I do not pass the interview, it is okay and we will move on to see what life redirects us 
        - Remember you are going to an interview to get to know the other person in the interview 
        - Set up a system that you feel comfortable with and good for your physical and mental health - so don't follow others, follow what makes your body feel best!!! 
        - This will help you over time in the future, in your career and in your life 
        - If you have a lot of on-site interviews, you know you will have more interviews coming ahead. Find as many as possible so you can practice more. 
        - You also need the time to reflect and study so give yourself the time to digest new habits - don't push too much! 
    - Find a buddy 
    - Build habits if possible
        - Do a deep work for 30 mins - 1 hour each day and follow the system 

#### Doing The Actual Interview 
- Walk the interviewer through a magical journey of the product you created 

1. Ask refining questions
    - Understand the problem + requirements 
        - Distinguish the functional and non-functional requirements 
        - Functional: What the users are doing? the feed feature? 
        - Non-functional: How much time needed to load the tweet? How reliable is the feed? 
        - Get feedback from the interviewer before you move on to other requirements 
    - Put on your product manager hat!
    - Prioritize key features 
    - Benefits: 
        - ensure that you are solving the correct problem 
        - show your ability to handle ambiguity 
    
2. Handle the data 
    - Whiteboard: write down the data and characteristics 
    - Understand the data and its characteristics (the size of the data, userId storage, data storage)
    - How will it be consumed? 
        - how is data goes from one end to another end? 
        - Example: Generating a feed on Twitter 
            - Read-heavy 
            - write down different assumptions that user might make 
            - some users have lots of tweets, others have none 
            - Pre-generate feed and push/pull it to clients
                - realtime? does it make sense to push/pull the data to the client? or should we let the user to make the decision? 
                - should we set a cron job? 
                - talk about the pros and cons 
    - What is data? How is the data being consumed? 

3. Discuss the components 
    - Draw boxes and arrows 
    - Write an API for each component 
    - End to end diagram on the board 
    - Common things to include: 
        - Load balancing 
        - Database 
        - Caching 
        - UI layer 
    - Have a diagram and being able to point to different part of the diagram during the interview 

4. Discuss Trade-Offs 
    - There is no right answer 
        - Understand the pros/cons
        - Everything has a cost 
        - Here is the idea that I come up with, here is the good part and here is the bad part, in terms of time and money aspect 
    - Talk about analysis + optimizations 
    - Discuss error handling + security 
    - Think into the future - What does not scale well? 
        - Break down in the next section! 
    - Traditionally, we always learn how to solve a problem in a specific way. But system design is all about the journey and not the final solution. It is how much QUALITY you can build along the journey and not the end desitination. This is exactly like our life, it is crucial to keep applying and be comfortable to go into the interview, but the crucial part is to be able to learn all the holes that you obviously noticed in yourself that you want to improve on. 

#### Think Into the Future 
    - Why people can become a senior engineer? - it is because they can think how far the software can go in the future - like 5 years ahead of time before you get there 

**HOW WE'RE TAUGHT**:
- expensive, high quality device 
- consistent screen size 
- most updated OS version 
- high battery 
- fast network 
- navigates UI perfectly 
- Everything works 

**WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS**: 
- Low RAM device 
- Small, short screen size 
- still using IE 7
- Low battery 
- 2G network 
- clicks buttons out of order 
- everything breaks 

KEY NOTE: it is really crucial to pay attention to the interviewer's reaction before you further in an idea or a problem. Non-verbal cues can be extremely helpful for you to know what you can focus on communicating -- it definitely takes experience to be more aware of this! 

#### Mature Software Principles 
- Robustness
    - Can your system continue to operate in strenuous conditions? (low ram devices)
    - "If the user has poor network, we will load a lower-resolution image." 
- Scalability 
    - Can your system hold up if user load greatly increases? (ie, Netflix!)
    - "We will build a geographically distributed network of CDNs to decrease loading latency."
- Performance 
    - Is your system smooth and fast? 
    - "We will upload the user's 4k selfie on a background thread, so they can continue using the app in the meantime."
- Extensibility 
    - Is it easy to add new features and modules to your system? 
    - "We will create a generic lesson view controller which pulls lesson content from a common config file on the cloud." (ie, Udemy)
- Resiliency 
    - If something breaks, can your system recover and keep functioning? 
    - "If the message fails to send, we will show a retry button to the user." (ie, Messenger)
    - how to continue to share a good user experience even there is something breaks? 


**REMEMBER YOU ARE BUILDING A STORY AND TELLING THE OTHER THE JOURNEY OF THE STORY**

**4 PARTS AND 5 PRINCIPLES**

#### What NOT TO DO during the interview 
- If you are coding, then you are failing 
    - Instead, draw boxes with arrows
    - draw out the API endpoints 

- Start building without a plan - Don't jump straight to the problem because it is really confusing!! 
    - You need to know all the requirements beforehand 

- Work in silence or spend more than 5 mins without interaction from the interviewer 
    - You want to make sure you have a conversation with the interviewer 
    - Always have a conversation! If you are not sure, ask your question or concern!

- Describe numbers (user traffic, image size) without a reason ~ if the numbers are important, you have to explain why it is important 
    - Here is what I want to tackle, and here is why the numbers I am going to say are important and why it is relevant to the system design 

- If you dont know something, dont paper over it. Acknowledge it instead. 
    - If you have not used the software (like TikTok), let the interviewer know that I do not know the software so can you explain what it is ~ it is better to face this upfront than wait ...
