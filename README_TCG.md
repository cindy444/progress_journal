#### 15 July 2021

**Reflection**: 

- Read the "[Choosing An Idea](https://chioualexander.medium.com/how-i-built-apps-with-over-1-million-downloads-part-1-choosing-ideas-725319d7332b)" Article from Alex Chiou

- Resolved an "Open in Default Browser" Issue in VSC - reset it on another laptop I will be using frequently - By installing the "_open in browser_" extension + use the shortcut "_Alt + B_" to open HTML in the default browser

- Attended a JavaScript Event and found out about "Webstorm" IDE ~ extremely great IDE. Find out more here: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ (~ there are a lot of great tools created by JetBrains)

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
```
- [ ] Focus to complete the UI for the simple Calculator using Bootstrap 5
```
#### 16 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed the basic UI for the simple Calculator using Bootstrap 5

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Add basic JavaScript logic to the buttons 
- Review Web Basics through Angela videos
- Brainstorm a simple project idea 

#### 17 July 2021

**Reflection**: 

- Watched the Youtube video [My Process of Designing and Architecting Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMamxmcurAQ) and understand ideas are coming from writing. **Write In order to Think**. Applied the method immediately and booked out around 2 hours of my time to just write and think along the way. 

- Brainstormed a project idea (does not seem like a simple idea)
    - I have written up around 4 written pages by pen. 3 of those pages are about the meditation app -> I guess it has been in my mind and I really want develop it 
    - The last page is about DSA visualizations to stand out in job applications 
    - My notes are messy so I just note down the general idea from the 3 pages below: 

```
Problem:
Missing a crucial feature a crucial feature: meditation consultation in many meditation applications 

Why? 
- An opportunity for people (with different life situations) to know the right meditation practice through a professional/Coach 

Best tech to build this: 
- VR (C# & Unity)
- Web (Frontend, Backend, AWS, or other DB types) <- Focus

```
```
General Notes

    - Meditation Coaches
        - View different Coaches background 
        - Schedule an appointment with them 
        - Option to meet in video call OR to meet in VR environment 
    - Meditation (exist only in VR environment)
    - Journal (w/ music option)
    - Coloring to share (w/ music option)

Coach: 
- Sign up/Login (Special Interview Process Required before able to sign up successfully)
- Once logged, the coach is able to have their own profile to write up their backgrounds and experience, have their email box 
- There are similar features: 
    - Clients
        - See their general profile 
        - Able to access the recorded sessions of the specific clients to track client's behavior overtime and review for work purpose 
        - See if there are appointments scheduled 
    - Meditation (exist in VR environmnet)    
```

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Add basic JavaScript logic to the buttons 
- Review Web Basics through Angela videos 

## Weekly Reflection 14-17 July 2021

Overall Accomplishments: 
- Set up a daily progress tracker system with Varun 
- Organized resources that I could easily tracked (reading, links)
- Read articles and watch Youtube videos that help me to know how to think of a software development idea: passion, problem, starting with basic utility app, and writing in order to think. 
- Constant communication with Varun and be an accountable study buddy who would actively track the learning and development progress 
- Start using Mimo App for Web Dev learning and entertainment before bed 

Need Improvements on: 
- Be faster in the process of going through basic Js, React concepts 
- Go through JavaScript DSA Udemy Course 
    - Build a DSA project based on what I have learned in the Udemy course
- Set up a DSA learning habit (a specific time on the calendar for at least 30 mins each day)
- Be clear in the 1 project development and see if I can break the idea down even smaller 

#### 18 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Watched and Completed all the JavaScript Fundamental videos from Angela in a speedy way - did multiple exercises along the way. 
- Coding Exercises from Angela are great because they are similar to interview questions. So I think they good to go over and to use for practice! (**practice how to think** from a really simple problem)
- Compared my codes with Angela's solution and reflected on how I could code a little more organized and better 
- After going through the fundamentals of JavaScript, really want to make the scope for this upcoming week study to be focus on Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript videos and exercises from Angela Yu. (especially the exercises are really a good way for me to have my foot wet before starting DSA in September)
- Key Takeaway: **Whatever you put in is whatever you get out of in coding, keep up the hard work!** ~ Angela Yu 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Complete the BMI Calculator Challenge from Angela (JavaScript fundamentals)
- Start to apply the fundamentals into the Calculator app that I am working on 

#### 19 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed the BMI Calculator Challenge from Angela (JavaScript fundamentals)
- Rewatched one of the JavaScript Function videos again to make sure I fully understand it  
- Completed Intermediate JavaScript 1/5 (Random Number Generator: Love Calculator Exercise)

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Start to apply the fundamentals into the Calculator app that I am working on (do this first!)
    - Make sure each buttons can be clicked and return a value
    - Make sure basic calculations can be performed 
- Get through Intermediate JavaScript 2/5 

#### 20 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Attended some online web dev events and get to learn a little ```CI/CD, Docker``` (definitely useful tools to learn in the future after completing my first frontend clone project)
- Took a while to debug, but able to find the use of ```onClick = "selectItem(id)"``` to lessen the repetitive code. I did not know that parameter could be pass through the HTML attribute onClick. Did google but unable to find useful info, but able to find some info after rephrasing what I was looking for. 
    - Take the time to think before googling 
    - **Key takeaway**: In HTML, the ```onClick``` function can pass any values including the HTML attribute (ie, ```id, type, class, value, etc```) of the same selector (ie, ```button, h1, p, etc```) in the parameter.
    - Completed the simple goal to have the buttons returning their associated values
- Completed Intermediate JavaScript 2/5

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Keep working on the Calculation app to add calculations + display number at the display window 
- Get through Intermediate JavaScript 3/5 & 4/5 (if possible)
- Think about this throughout the week regarding to a simple feature to develop on a clone project - what kind of clone project that you would like to do and to have the interest to work on!

- Completed the simple calculations for the Calculation app (not yet display the number at the display window) - took sometimes to debug due to unfamilarity with the **equal** ```===``` sign and the **assigned** ```=``` sign. I was confused with the printing language syntax I used daily. ~ Definitely good exercise to refresh and make sure to be aware of the ```syntax``` when coding in JavaScript. 
- Completed Intermediate JavaScript 3/5

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Get through all Intermediate JavaScript 
- Start to go over the DOM section ~ this will be a good refresh before doing the display window for the calculation app 
- Familiarize with the VSC debug tool for JavaScript 
- Think about this throughout the week regarding to a simple feature to develop on a clone project - what kind of clone project that you would like to do and to have the interest to work on! 

#### 22 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed Intermediate JavaScript (still have 3 challenges left to do) 
- Possible Project Idea #1: Clone project on indeed/Linkedin ~ Job Search Section
    - Features to have: Time zone + visualization, customizable messaging to save copy & paste time, resume analyzer functionality, etc. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Get through the DOM section ~ this will be a good refresh before doing the display window for the calculation app 
- Familiarize with the VSC debug tool for JavaScript 
- Think about this throughout the week regarding to a simple feature to develop on a clone project - what kind of clone project that you would like to do and to have the interest to work on! ~~ keep writing down different 2 more clone project ideas

#### 23 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed the whole DOM section 
- Possible Project Idea #2: Clone project on Trulia, Zillow ~ Map & Description Section 
    - Features to have: 
        - Finding Direction from the dream house to the current house in the same window without the need to toggle over to a new page ie, the Google Map
        - Displaying a different type of visualization on the timeline of a certain aspect of the house (ie, the price differences after placing on the market) 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through the different Intermediate Js, DOM exercises 
- Go through Advanced JavaScript + exercises 
- Go through JQuery + exercises (if possible) 
- Think of 1 more clone project idea 
- Brainstorm all the ideas on Sunday and Pick One to focus on!!

#### 24 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed all the Intermediate Js exercises 
- Completed Advanced Js 1/3
- Think of 1 more clone project idea, but writing writing down several ones, but they all do not have the problem or feature I am looking for especially after doing some research in the market. One of the idea is for a Youtube clone project: 
    - Feature could be visualization on comments, sort out comments and place into 2 or 3 categories (positive, negative, questions) -- Hootsuite seems to have some functionalities, but I have not used it before so I did not know ~ 
    - Another feature could be adding a payment method so content creater can promote their items and viewers can make a purchase straight from youtube and without the need to redirect to another website to make purchases.
- Progress is not as fast as I thought for today since I want to take slightly more time in going through Advanced Js since there are some materials I did not know before 
- Spent longer time than I thought working through the Intermediate Js exercises 
- Unable to start REACT yet. Need to make sure I am comfortable in what I am learning in Js first. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Brainstorm all the ideas on Sunday and Pick One to focus on!!
- Go through Advanced JavaScript + exercises 
- Go through JQuery + exercises

## Weekly Reflection 18-24 July 2021

Accomplishments: 
- Completed Intro to Js, Intermediate Js, DOM & Js - Angela Yu 
- Attended events and got to know about CI/CD, Docker, and Networked professionals in the IT field  
- Prepared clone project ideas 
- Starting the Advanced Js

Goals for the Upcoming Week: 
- Familiarize with VSC debug tool (an overall review)
- Complete Advanced Js, JQuery, Backend Basics, Node.js, Express, APIs, Databases, EJS, React 
- Complete the Calculator app 
- Research more about the chosen clone project idea/problem 


#### 25 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed Advanced JavaScript + exercises (ie, completed a DrumKit application with my own codes after watching through the tutorials)
- Brainstorm all the problems from the 3 clone project ideas:

```
Clone Project #1: Indeed/Linkedin (Job search section)
Problems: 
1) Lack of Time Zone Job Search Option 
2) Lack of a message customizable option that allow users to be able to send out messages faster
3) Lack of Resume Analyzer functionality to help to analyze if Resume meets the standard and have correct keywords used 

```
```
Clone Project #2: Trulia/Zillow (Map feature)
Problems: 
1) Users need to toggle to a new page (like Google Map) to view directions and time from prospective home to current home 
2) Lack of Transparency of the house quality ~ not so clear about this problem and can be more complicated to imprement 
```

```
Clone Project #3: Youtube (Data in Comments OR Payment Methods)
Problems: 
1) Lack of the comment data organization/categorization (positive, negative, questions found in comments) to help content managers in managing contents for viewers ~ heard that Hootsuite is solving this issue, but not entirely sure
2) Lack of a payment methods option to allow content creator to share their products straight from the Youtube site instead of relocating/redirecting to a new webpage 
```
- I personally find the first clone project idea more interested to me and a little more useful in my own opinion 

- Another change of plan: instead of starting React this week, focus on getting through the basics in Backend dev, apis, and database to know how the full stack dev works. The clone project requires this area of knowledge in order to make it more interesting to build. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through JQuery + exercises
- Apply what I learn into the calculator app 

#### 26 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed JQuery section (fast watch through it and get a general idea of it - it is not as popular in the job market, but finds it can be useful in doing small mini project dev)
- Wrote out my idea and problem into a piece of paper. Feels like the problem is still too general and I need to break it into smaller pieces and able to be clear what the problem is. Currently focusing on the Clone Project idea #1. 

```
Current Job Search Trend:
People tend to focus toward networking, referral, and connections with recruiters in job search.

Problem:
Sending personalized messages become a way to help us to network and connect with individuals who would be able to share their experience with us (this way it helps us to navigate in our own career path). But it can be time-consuming when you have to send multiple similar messages to multiple professionals  (with a lot of copy and paste).

Possible Solution:
Based on this problem, I am thinking to create a clone project of indeed/LinkedIn Jobs and to focus a feature that allows users to send customized personalized messages in a short period of time to multiple individuals by (1) prompt/template provided (just a single click to generate basic layout) (2) Grouping the people they want to send the message to (3) With one click, they can send a personalized message to 50 linkedin connections.
```

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through Node.js section (45 mins)
- Apply what I learn into the calculator app - use jQuery to manipulate the DOM (20 mins)


#### 27 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed Node.js Basics (1/2) 
- Attended a JavaScript workshop to revisit and revise on Hoisting, Higher-order function, and Scoping 
- Got Feedback from the project idea from Alex Chiou, he has mentioned regarding to the problem I mentioned regarding to ```sending personalized messages to multiple connections within 1 click```, because there isn't any APIs available to be able to send multiple messages at once under Linkedin. Regarding to the practicality of the idea, it might be a little harder to implement due to lack of APIs. He has suggested maybe to think about a possible "Quick Apply" feature. After hearing from Alex, I have rewrote my problem and solution below: 

```
Problem: Time-consuming Job Application process

Possible Solution:

There is a possibility to shift gear a little and consider the feature of "Quick Apply"? -> this means the individuals are able to apply for multiple similar positions by 1 click. Similar to "Easy Apply" in Linkedin, but instead of clicking on "Easy Apply" every single time for every jobs, the user can just click "Quick Apply" and then they can apply to multiple positions with 1 click only. This would save a lot of time, especially when we want to focus our time in preparing for interviews or other preparations (for our favorite company), instead of using a lot of time in _basic_ online applications. 
```

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through Node.js (2/2)
- Go through Express Node.js 
- Apply what I learn into the calculator app - use jQuery to manipulate the DOM (20 mins)


#### 28 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed Node.js 
- Completed Express Node.js (2/3) ~ creating a server side calculator with the guidance from Angela ~ all logic will be taken place in the server 
    - Change of plan in the calculator app, want to complete the lesson in Express Node.js + APIs and apply those knowledge learned into the calculator app that I am working on. 
- After reading through Varun Slack comment regarding to the clone project idea, I would like to note it here as a reference: 

```
Varun's Shared Thought on the Clone Project of Linkedin "Quick Apply" Feature" (see below)

I can see the MVP  designed as follows:

1. Retrieve multiple JDs (can use existing solutions via APIs, if they are available, otherwise it can be a sub project in itself)

2. Group them based on similarities (existing solutions should be used because it will get complicated, but you need to know how its working behind the scene. Work on it separately only if existing solutions don't work like you want them to)

3. On the hitting the apply button requests to all the job URLs will be sent with the Resume that you have stored
```

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through Express Node.js (3/3)
- Go through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 


#### 29 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed Express Node.js ~ completed the server side calculator example, but I think there is a better way to do a post call then using the attribute ```<form method="post">``` ~ need to find out more about this. 
- Completed APIs (1/3) ~ starting with understanding basic API terminologies:
    - Endpoints
    - Paths
    - Parameters (in another word: Query)
    - Authentication 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through APIs and best to complete it if possible (do the exercises along the way)


#### 30 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed APIs section 2/3 (still have a little more to go)
- Feels like the progress is going slower and motivation starts to decrease. So I need to change the learning strategy a little. I think I will start to go through materials more quicker. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Due to some family events going on during the day, I think I should try my best to complete the following: 
    - Complete the APIs section 

    Starting From Here: (Generally going through by taking notes ~ Once I have run through all the videos, then go back and do all the exercises on the area that I am not familiar with ~ Make marks ie, PRACTICE NEEDED in my note!!)
    **KEY: REMEMBER TO WRITE DOWN KEY POINTS ONCE YOU HAVE WATCHED THROUGH EACH VIDEO** 
    - Go through Database, SQL, noSQL (MongoDB), Mongoose 
    - Go through RESTful API 
    - Go through Authentication & Security 

    (For Next Week to commit working on REACT only) + Getting ready to start the clone project (I know that I will encounter a lot of issues along the way, but it is better to start using what I have learned in an actual project -> this way I can tell what I have learned and sticked, as well as what I should practice more)
    - Go through React.js 

#### 31 July 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Met with Varun today and noted down the discussion: 

```
1. Create a visualization of the clone project idea (Basic frontend visual design) ~ LinkedIn Jobs Page is a good example
2. Think about the visual design throughout the learning process in the backend and the React lessons 
    - When learning React, please be aware of the React Components and understand their functionalities 
    - React Documentation is a great to learn (utilize it while learning)
```
3. **First Draft: Focus on the core functionality feature "Quick Apply" using the Dummy Data** 
    - Consider using existing npm packages when working on this feature (for search or sort, etc.) 
    - No need to go into Database, the core function is what matters 
    - Here are some of my thoughts:
        - Create a Constructor that can create multiple Dummy Data objects 
        - Create around 10 objects 
        - Identify the query options (ie, Job Title "Jr. Software Engineer", Location "USA")
        - Identify the factors to group for similar jobs (ie, they share the same query option, the similar required skills, the similar JD)
        - The problem is regarding to Quick Apply -- how to send the applications and make sure it is sent and apply for the applicants?? NEED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT FOR THIS PROCESS!! 
4. Second Draft: Focus on the external APIs (Linkedin API, Indeed API) using Node.js to retrieve info in the backend 
5. Third Draft: Focus on Database and REST APIs to store the retrieved data from external APIs and then access them when needed in the frontend
6. Forth Draft: Focus on UX/UI 
7. Fifth Draft: Focus on CI/CD + PR (peer review) Process

__

- Completed External APIs course 
- Completed EJS course (Embedded JavaScript Templates ~ a simple templating language uses to generate HTML markup with plain Js. It helps embed Js to HTML pages) ~ I went through this course fast and note down key points. This templating method is no longer used but there are some organization aspect I find really useful in the clone project and that I think may help me when I learn React later on. 
- Skipped through all the exercises for now since the focus is to get the basic idea of the whole full stack noted down 
- I spent most of my time with family, but I am able to use 2 hours of my time to get a lot of learning done. This is unexpected to me. I also know the point that I need to take rest, which is good. This means I start to be aware of my physical and mental health. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through Database (SQL)
- Go through Database (noSQL) - MongoDB
- Go through Mongoose 

A DAY JUST TO SPEND TIME WITH DATABASE!

- Completed RESTful API (1/3)

- Had a meeting with a C# classmate and need to replan or rethink about how to spent around 3-4 hrs each week to make some progress in my C#/Unity learning progress. Felt a little disappointed since progress has been made slowly in C#, but I understand that I have been making a lot of progress in web dev. I just need to be a little more strategic in planning out my C# learning sessions. Less is more.

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through RESTful APIs (2/3)
- Visualization needed for the clone project


#### 03 August 2021

**Reflection**:

#### 13 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed React.js (3/3)  
    - Changing Complex State
    - ES6 Spread Operator
    - Managing Component Tree 
    - Feel like I still have not fully grasped the third section, but I kind of note down the general idea from watching the tutorials

- Congratulations on finishing up the basic React fundamental journey!!!! Hooray!!!! Now, I mean tomorrow is the beginning of the real fun development journey! well I know it is definitely going to be really challenging, but remember to google or search your notes whenever you are stuck or you need help!!! 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Revisit and review the previous Visualization + write out anything in your mind regarding to the design of the clone project application - just write a bunch out (regarding to the process - and whatever it is in my mind)
- Practice A React Exercise from Angela 
- Spend 1 hr on C# to put some notes together 

#### 14 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Revisited and reviewed the previous Visualization + write out anything in your mind regarding to the design of the clone project application - just write a bunch out (regarding to the process - and whatever it is in my mind)
    - After looking at what I have learned and what I can build with the skills that I have so far, instead of overwhelming myself with a big big feature, I want to make the tasks that I would like to accomplish as small as possible. Instead of doing a "Quick Apply" core feature, I have switched to create a note-taking core feature in job search platform application. For the MVP, it will only have 1 search and 1 applied page as seen below. It seems pretty simple, but it requires a lot of attention in authentication and full stack. I want to make it simple and also an application that I WILL USE MYSELF. After thinking and exploring today, this is what I decided to do starting tomorrow. I recalled from Alex, it is CRUCIAL TO LEARN HOW TO WALK FIRST BEFORE START RUNNING!
        - Design Tech Stacks: Js ES6, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport, OAuth (using everything I have learned from Angela)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24945340/129466361-8157faf0-146b-4ba5-a916-37c9c77083d3.jpg"  width="70%" height="70%" />

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24945340/129466362-9ab0bade-0936-4e9f-93c1-60bcca98e5a1.jpg"  width="70%" height="70%" />

- Did not get the chance to work on React Practice from Angela, but I will want to get to this sometimes tomorrow or Monday

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Setup the skeleton (create the local environment using React)
- Practice A React Exercise from Angela 
- Spend 1 hr on C# to put some notes together  


#### 15 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- wrote down more notes and visualizations taken on the clone project - Decided to name this project as JXT (Job Search & Track)
- Created the local environment using React
    - Re-watched through Angela video on setting up local environment, but realize since I need to apply backend express, I have to set it up in a way to take the backend into consideration
    - I am still unable to connect setup the node.js express server to React and just found an article online and someone has written about this so I am going to through it tomorrow and apply it to the local environment setup. Here are the first 2 search results found in Google: 
        - Class programming (old): https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-setup-nodejs-express-for-react/ 
        - Functional programming - Hooks (new): https://dev.to/pratham10/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-express-server-for-react-2fja

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Setup the skeleton (create the local environment using React) - Front and Back (be familiar with how to make basic CRUD)
- Setup the authentication (passport and OAuth2.0)


#### 16 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Setup the local environment and make sure Data Fetching works and information are able to GET to the frontend to display from the backend server SUCCESSFULLY!  
- Researched, Read, and Took notes on Data Fetching because it is a new terminology for me!! 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Setup a reusable component for inputs - username and password 
- Setup a reusable component for button - submit 
- Setup the authentication (passport and OAuth2.0)


#### 17 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Attended 2 events (from Big(O)n and Jai) today, one of them is regarding JavaScript Design Patterns. I am extremely glad that I attended this event to get to know the importance of having Redux considered when planning my simple side project.
- Basic definition of Redux found on Google: 
```
Redux is used mostly for application state management. To summarize it, Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can't be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers).

```
- I did not do what I was supposed to do (planned from yesterday), because before I am going to start implementing authentication, it is crucial to learn and apply Redux into my side project. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Setup Redux on my React App: https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started 
- Go through the following materials to learn a little more about Redux: 
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQXNp9ItL4
    - https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview 
    - https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow 
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY 

Go through the following after learning and setting up Redux: 
- Setup a reusable component for inputs - username and password 
- Setup a reusable component for button - submit 
- Setup the authentication (passport and OAuth2.0)

#### 18 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Setup a reusable component for input
- Setup a reusable component for button
- Communicated with Alex Chiou and he mentioned that as of now it is better not to include Redux framework into my side project since the key part is to be able to use what I have learned so far and build the the side project.  After evaluating, I feel like the Redux is not necessary due to simplicility of the UI uses in my project. ~ change of plan and now just follow my previous plan and continue to work on components and authentication setup. 
- Got distracted today and was not able to focus on this project. I have decided to stop all the distractions starting tomorrow. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Use the reusable component for username and password inputs in App.js
- Use the reusable component for submit button in App.js
- Setup the authentication (passport and OAuth2.0) ~ revisited my notes when needed

#### 19 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Able to use the reusable components but still need to make sure the form is added properly, therefore:
- Created the Local login and sign up forms components 
- Created several folders inside of the components main folder for better organization
- Reviewed the Airbnb website login authentication as guidance when setting all these pages up 
- Added onKeyPress function in the input as a prop 
- Still have not yet set up the authentication, but has been productive in organizing and setting up components

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Setup the authentication using Passport.js only for now + connection with MongoDB/Mongoose + please apply Salting and Hashing 
    - Establish the connection with MongoDB
    - Able to store basic info
    - Then start applying Passport.js 
    - After that, Salting and Hashing 


#### 20 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- After consulting with Alex, he has suggested it is crucial to deploy an application as early as possible so I have changed my goal and set to make sure I can deploy my app today, and the result is: 

- Yay! I have successfully deployed my simple app to Heroku. It basically has nothing on the page just a text being sent using the API endpoint 

- I have spent around 2 hours more or less debugging 2 errors I got during the deployment process, but it was resolved and I have documented it down the step-by-step process for my Heroku deployment process. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Setup the authentication using Passport.js only for now + connection with MongoDB/Mongoose + please apply Salting and Hashing 
    - Establish the connection with MongoDB
    - Able to store basic info
    - Then start applying Passport.js 
    - After that, Salting and Hashing 


#### 21 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Focused on visualization using the site https://excalidraw.com/ to re-create the visualization digitally so I could see it on the page during my development. Being able to clearly visualize the project is key and this tool is super useful! 
- Wrote down the progress for the next stage of the development on paper 
- Even though I did not work on the authentication and connection with MongoDB, I am glad I sit down to write down more of the development process, which would lessen the time to think during production. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Complete "Save" and "Track" Page visualizations 
- Setup the authentication using Passport.js only for now + connection with MongoDB/Mongoose + please apply Salting and Hashing 
    - Establish the connection with MongoDB
    - Able to store basic info
    - Then start applying Passport.js 
    - After that, Salting and Hashing 

#### 22 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed "Save" and "Track" Page visualizations 
- However, after viewing the visualizations as well as discussing them with my mentor, I realized that I still need more focus and planning on my side project idea. Especially I need to know the main value I want to get out of the core feature. I am thinking to switch from the focus on the search page to focus mainly on the Track page only using dummy data instead. I will need some time tomorrow to rewrite my whole entire development and planning process for this side project. 
- The plan and design are actually taking longer time than I thought, but I am glad I am making progress every day!! Keep going!! 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:   
- Write down the new core feature idea as well as the possible process and problems/obstacles and future research 
- Set up a new weekly goal 

#### 23 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Learned about the Octalysis Framework for Gamification & Behavioral design to help to know how to think when designing a product 
- Wrote down some ideas regarding the new core feature to focus on Job Tracking only instead of Job Searching. The question I need to think and write about is: "What drives people to go to use this application frequently?" "What kind of values do people get out of using it?" ~ still brainstorming in writing and drawing. I am getting some books to read that could help me to think better in product design and development. 
- My weekly goal is to focus on brainstorming, drawing, researching, reading, and trying out different tools for the development of the side project idea - Job Tracking 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Keep brainstorming in writing and drawing on the core feature 
- Explore how to create a simple Chrome Extension using ReactJs 
- Connect the deployed app with mongoDB/mongoose (optional)

#### 24 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- After thinking through the ideas and discussing with a friend, I think it is crucial to make a harsh sprint for myself to accomplish instead of being distracted with the goal of not being specific enough. 
- Job tracking app 3 features: 

```
1. Track all jobs one has applied to 

2. Quick and easy update on the status of a particular job 

3. Access to resume for a job application (easily accessible over time without the need to go to google drive when doing multiple applications)

```

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Explore how to create a simple Chrome Extension using ReactJs <-- Focus on this one!!! 
- Keep brainstorming in writing and drawing on the core feature 
- Connect the deployed app with mongoDB/mongoose (optional)

#### 25 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Brainstormed the 3 features of the job track side project idea more: 
```
Main Feature Input - Track Jobs Applied using the Extension on the web (detect when user clicks on any “Apply” button, and detect when user clicks on “Submit” button), Quick and Easy authentication process through the extension

Main Feature Input 2 - Set Goals + Quick and Easy update on the status of the job applications (by daily check in on phone calls, emails, interviews - user can just enter number - if “0”, no further questions, if more than “0", then user can simply search for the company name or role, then enter the status of the application and reflection) 

Main Feature Output - Using info collected, to display the visualization and show a bigger picture of the Job applications (ie, how many jobs applied? how many responded (who)? how many interviewed (who)? Common resumes one has used to apply?)

Resume Efficiency in Job Applications - this is debatable one, because it definitely would help the job seekers to see which Resume gets more attention in their job applications. But it is crucial to consider that a resume is not the only factor that directly influences the responsive rate. There can be other factors other than resume. 

```
- Found a resource that helps me to learn how to create a simple Chrome extension using React "https://dev.to/anobjectisa/build-a-chrome-extension-using-reactjs-38o7"

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through how to create a simple Chrome Extension using ReactJs 
- Keep brainstorming in writing and drawing on the core feature 
- Connect the deployed app with mongoDB/mongoose (optional)

#### 26 August 2021

**Reflection**:
- Discussed with Alex Chiou and he mentioned that it would be best to focus on working on the web app first to have it working with basic inputs and dashboard output. ~ put Chrome extension learning and resume analysis on a side for now and focus on the mvp of basic input and output only. 
- **My 1st Sprint is to have at least the basic frontend Job App Input Page where information can be insert from the frontend and store in the backend (MongoDB), then the info can be pulled to be used or displayed in the frontend Dashboard Page. (NO NEED TO SET UP THE AUTHENTICATION FOR NOW)**
- Installed mongoose in the current project and refreshed on the concepts and codes on mongoose and mongoDB through Angela videos and through my own notes - run into an issue and will keep working on it tomorrow  

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Work through the issue regarding adding specific data in the collection ~ mongoDB
- Put the frontend and backend together ~ test only to see how everything is linked 


#### 27 August 2021

    - Dummy sign up and Dummy login 
    - Once login in -> direct to a page to choose between "Insert" or "Track"


#### 28 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Attended the Resume event from Alex and Rahul and took notes, you can find my notes [here](https://github.com/ngl4/Progress-Tracker-TCG/blob/main/Resources/Alex-Rahul-Event-Sessions.md#how-to-write-a-stellar-tech-resume-that-gets-you-more-job-opportunities---august-28-2021)

- Attended another local event from Jonathan to learn about React Redux and really glad to get to know about React Hooks, props, proptypes and they are super helpful for my React project. The great news is I know I definitely do not want to use Redux since it is not necessarily needed. But it is always good to know how it works in codes

- Learn a ton from attending these events today and I would like to apply what I have learned when working on my side project tomorrow

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Put the frontend and backend together ~ test only to see how everything is linked
    - Dummy sign up and Dummy login 
    - Once login in -> direct to a page to choose between "Insert" or "Track"

#### 29 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed Bootstrap setup for the side project for the sign up dummy page (just for testing) ~ took longer than I expected. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Put the frontend and backend together ~ test only to see how everything is linked
    - Dummy sign up and Dummy login 
    - Once login in -> direct to a page to choose between "Insert" or "Track"

#### 30 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Spent a large amount of time to see why the deployed site is not updating as the github changes - still did not know why
- Tried to send data to the database using fetch, but still trying to find out the correct way to send data from the front-end to the backend in React 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through and find out the right API call to send data from the frontend to the backend 
- Then send data from the backend (db) to the frontend 


#### 31 August 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Reached out to TCG community to ask for help, Vui Chee Siew, Alex Chiou, and Emmanuel Fanibi got back to me and they mentioned about possible way to resolve the similar issue (for those who does their builds correctly): (1) Hard Refresh (2) Disable Cache in Inspect > Network (3) Heroku Exec (try ssh into heroku instance and check out if the code actually changed)

- Resolved the issue regarding to Heroku deployed site is not updating in sync with the github changes 
    - The reason is a missing step - the old build folder was not updated/replaced with a new build folder 
    - Simple ```npm run build``` in the React client folder and then replaced the old build folder from the root with the new build folder 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go through and find out the right API call to send data from the frontend to the backend 
- Then send data from the backend (db) to the frontend 

#### 01 September 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed and found out the right API call to send data from the frontend to the backend. Took a while to debug, but after checking this "https://github.com/github/fetch/issues/323#issuecomment-335778085" issue, I am able to resolve the body not parsing issue. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- send data from the backend to the database

#### 02 September 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed - able to send data from the backend to the database 
- Attended Eric Chiu's event on Recursion workshop. Noted down things I learn from the recursion session, still have a lot of things I do not get. Need more learning and practicing. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Figure out the issue of users model created inside of the Collections folder and not the User folder 
- Send data from the backend to the frontend 

#### 03 September 2021

**Reflection**: 
- It was not really an issue regarding the users model inside the Collections folder and not the User folder. It is in default in MongoDB, that there are 3 folders (collections, functions, users) that existed for every new DB created. When we are writing the codes in the server, we are creating a model and it is being saved mainly in the Collections folder.

- Pretty tired today and could hardly focus on writing codes. Need to get some rest and sleep to recover and keep learning and coding tomorrow. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Send data from the backend to the frontend (testing)
- Create simple visualization (simple sign up, simple login, simple logout, simple send information to db, and the information would be saving into the specific user document, these information would be able to retrieve and display in the frontend)

#### 04 September 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed - Send data from the backend to the frontend (testing)

- Got feedback from Rahul regarding the approach to take and as he suggests - automation might not be necessary since we could write our own cron logic instead ~ really good advise and guide me in the right direction. Finally get some codes running! Really excited! 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Go over to test my own cron logic on multiple items in an array + create an inactive page to visualize the update 
- DSA Section 5 
- Work on 1 new easy algo question on Hackerrank + Practice 1 easy algo question

**Reflection**: 
- Completed - writing down important questions to think about during interviews 
- Completed - 1 more exercism question on Space Age exercise (a lot of math involve and pretty fun exercise to do)

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Do the tech assessment in Ruby 
- Take a break! 

#### 04 December 2021

**Reflection**:
- Completed - the technical assessment in Ruby - I only get through 1 test case, even though I could not resolve the problem, I fully understand the problem this time and have some ideas to know how to approach the problem. Great work to be able to learn Ruby quickly in a week and take the assessment!! Congrats to myself and I prove to myself that there is nothing is impossible!

- It 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Work on JXT project (only on JXT) - Create a new sample job card in the frontend to test if job data can be entered in the frontend and stored into the new User model in the database (Are job apps be stored in the right format in the array? and find out if the mongoose method is performing as I expect it to be)

#### 09 December 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed - worked on JXT and chose new Bootstrap card design for the new job card (version 2). I ave reorganized the folders and renamed some components. It is a good start at least I start to have something secret track page for authenticated users. 
- Met with Adam, CSS Developer Advocate, for around 40 mins and learned a tons from him - the key takeaway from the conversation is definitely "Show, Don't Tell" mindset - it is better to show our skills through our works rather than telling others about them! 
- After the conversation, I have decided to focus on working on my project for this month & January 2022, as well as, my coding fluency skillset in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is better to spend the time in doing what I like to do. So I have decided to spend less time in job searching (I will still do this but only 1 day in a week). The rest of days in the week will be focusing on developing my project, practicing all the basics, and putting together a new portfolio. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Read Tamal's blog post and comment 
- JXT - work on the authenticated enter page 
- Create an action plan for improving my frontend development basics and skills 

#### 10 December 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed - provided my feedback to [Tamal's recent blog post on Image Compression](https://tamalweb.com/compress-images-reactjs). I have spent around a little more than an hour on this to take some notes and respond with what I like and what can be improved. Hopefully some of the notes can be helpful to Tamal in his current blog post. I have learned a lot from Tamal's blog post style and I can tell he has put a lot of effort and thought in putting it together. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- JXT - work on the authenticated enter page 
- Create an action plan for improving my frontend development basics and skills 

#### 11 December 2021

**Reflection**: 
- Completed - setup the test version of the authenticated enter page 
- Completed - 2 exercises in Exercism JavaScript (2/133)
- Completed - Action plan is to focus on going through the basics using the following learning resources: 

1. **Exercism** - JavaScript only (133 exercises total) ~ please utilize the mentorship and learn from others! 

2. **FreeCodeCamp** (please complete them until you get the certificate!)
    - Responsive Web Design 
    - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 
    - Front End Development Libraries 
    - Data Visualization (for JXT project)
    - Back End Development and APIs 
    - Coding Interview Prep 

3. **Udemy** 
    - Angela Yu's Web Development (rewatch quickly/relearn/redo everything again!!)
    - Colt Steele's JavaScript and Data Structures Masterclass (please rewatch it and make sure to complete the entire course this time!!)

- Based on what I have learned to document them down the concepts down through my journal, blog post, or by applying them to mini-projects, portfolio project, or side projects. Here are the main playgrounds and documentation: 

1. JXT Job Track Web Application (Side Project)

2. WEB.DEV (Blog Post) && Personal Web Dev Journal 

3. Redesign and Create a brand new Portfolio Website (writing CSS from scratch)  

- Based on my progress in the past few weeks and months, I realize the importance of creating an action plan that I feel motivated! I also think in order to improve my code fluency in frontend development, it is super important to really have clear goals and directions that I know what to do each day/week.

- Instead of writing a blog, I have noted down in my journal regarding my end of year reflection. 

- I did not work on JXT today. I did not accomplish the goal to complete the MVP of the project by the end of 2021, but it is not the end. I have set new goals in the upcoming months to make sure I am able to find time to focus on working on JXT side project outside of my daily learning progress to improve my code fluency. 

- In the goal setting of the upcoming year 2022, one of them is to find a new job. I did not accomplish this goal in 2021, but I am going to keep practicing, learning, and preparing myself to pursue a new job in 2022. 

- I have decided to increase the amount of applications by setting up a concrete goal to make sure I could accomplish it daily, weekly, and monthly. 

- Consistent progress is what matters most. I would like to experiment and find a pace that I feel comfortable with and I am not stress out because of the pace.

#100DaysOfCode #JavaScript #frontend #womenintech #Exercism #FreeCodeCamp 

(more in comment)

Finally, completed all learning exercises on Exercism!!  
Map object (Hashmap) vs Set object - they are really similar, the diff is Set object contains only unique values 
set.add(), set.delete(), [...set] can convert a set into an array 
Promise - the Translation Service Exercise in Exercism is definitely the most challenging problem in comparison with other learning exercises. Anyway in short, Promise - object return either completion or failure of an async operation
Promise.then(), Promise.catch(), Promise.finally()

- Attended the Algo Hours with Jonathan Watson to learn more about an algorithm tech interview problem asked by JP Morgan - [here] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63027987/write-a-program-that-returns-integers-corresponding-to-the-numerals-used-to-form). -- super super hard problem!!! 

- Promise is definitely a hard concept that I still do not fully understand.

Glad to get a refresh on JQuery and good to know the following: 
1. $("#target").clone().appendTo("body")

Redux-React - Have not started on Redux, only start with adding class constructor, handleChange and handleSubmit methods

- Used FindIndex and Splice methods in the exercise 
- Took some time to debug my code in the PersonalBest method in the constructor - in order to know the last index, set the index + 1 === undefined instead of !index (bc this if-statement would run when there is zero in the array)

Completed the Triangle Exercise (14/14 test cases) 
array.every() - used to iterate through an array to see if it matches a certain condition and return true or false 
ie, array.every((elem) => elem > 10); when every item in the array is bigger than 10, then it would return true, else if one of them is smaller than 10, return false; 
The FCC codepen template link issue resolved, the main reason I got the weird issue is because my JS pen setting did not contain the FCC test script.

Getter - used to bind an object property to a function ~ find out more in MDN
The use of "_" before property name ie, "this._name" indicates that it is private and only accessible within the class method - this is a naming convention in Js. 
Generally noted down the portfolio design layout preference. I will share more once I have started to have some designs built out

Used string.padStart() and string.padEnd() js methods - apply padding to the beginning and the end of the current string 

Mainly focusing on working on Exercism today. Did not get the chance to get to the FCC mini-personal portfolio project

Instead of copy-paste, I have worked on the problem in my own way following the similar logic/approach. 

I will be working on my personal portfolio and a side project in the meantime so I will stick with updating my Exercism progress. I will add some notes or screenshots regarding my progress in my personal portfolio/side project.

There are two functions - encoding and decoding. Completed the decoding function today. 
I think the solution is not ideal for hte decoding function, it would not work if there is an edge test case like this: "100W3I2022N"- any number digits that are over 2 would not work based on the solution in place. Something to think about for the future iterations on this problem.

#100DaysOfCode #JavaScript #womenintech #Exercism 

(more in comment)

Completed Binary Search Exercise (passed all test cases)
Binary Search Algo is used only when we have a "Sorted" array/collection. 
In daily life, we could use it when searching through a sorted list of word dictionary or a sorted list of telephone book. These are examples that are given in the Exercism which I find them to be a great introduction to binary search algo. 
Used recursive approach to solve the problem, and it can be done in iterative approach as well!! 

Here is my solution: 
https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/binary-search/solutions/ngl4

- Had two pair learning sessions with Formation fellows - Andrew Koo and Zaneh Williams 

- Learned a lot about ValidateBST and Binary Search Algos!!

Completed (5/10 test cases) Binary Search Tree Exercise 
Able to pass three more test cases!! Yay! Definitely challenging and need to understand how "this" is functioning in the insert() method
Used recursion to pass all the test cases in the insert method
Now I have completed the Insert() method of the BinarySearchTree class
The rest of the test cases are on sorting data of the binary search tree 

- Reviewed BFS and Had around an hour session with Formation fellow - Andrew Koo! I have learned a lot from him and I hope I can be better being a host and answering questions from the participants in the future. I know I am going to be a participant next week so I better be prepared to code on each session and learn more from the host. 

- Worked through quickly - like 5 mins -ish on each Algo tasks just so I have a better understanding of how they work. I am going to do it after submitting this progress today

Completed (10/10 test cases) Binary Search Tree Exercise 
I am able to successfully set up the skeleton of the logic but unable to find a solution 
After getting stuck for a while, I went over some community solutions and get a better idea how others solve the problem 
The each() method contains a callback function that would return the specific node value 
Since this is a binary search tree, all left nodes should be smaller than the root node, and all the right nodes should be larger than the root node. 
The each() method should be ordered in left, root, then right in order for the node data to be sorted correctly 

- Worked on 1 algo workout session with Jeremy to work through a problem to find the unique number value missing in the array 

- Worked on 1 pair programming session to solve the algo problem on - Count element in binary tree (recursive and iterative)

- I have volunteered to the first algo workout session and I am super glad that I have the courage to do so. You are amazing Cindy! Even though you did not get the right answer, but still you are able to understand the problem based on the mistake you made. Good job!

Completed (9/13 test cases) Darts Exercise 
Based on where you lands from the target, player will earn different points 
The challenge part in this exercise is to know how to identify if the dart is 'just' outside of the circle or not
I am still not sure how to approach this and I will work on this more tomorrow 

- Worked on an algo workout session but did not do well. I feel like I have a hard time going through this session. Feel like I am way further than I thought. Still have a hard time approaching the unknown problem using the toolkits I have in the pocket. 

- Progress checked. Work on a new Exercism problem but I am not entirely sure a right way to approach it. I have mainly worked on formation tasks. I really have to be work around my anxiety when getting into a group mocked tech interview learning session at Formation. I feel like I am not thinking properly haha. Need to practice to get used to being in an uncomfortable situation.

- Practicing algo and actually doing it with another programmer is definitely really different. I feel like it is just not about learning the pattern and the tool, but it is about what to pick to use when an unfamiliar problem occurs

✅Completed (13/13 test cases) Darts Exercise 
➡️Used Math.sqrt() and Math.abs() to solve the problem!! 
😅I am surprised this is an easier question than I thought. I over-complicated it. 

👉I just need to find the hypotenuse (distance between the target and the point where the tip dart lands) and then compare it with the radius units
👉Based on different radius units, different scores will be generated. Pretty straightforward math question lol 🤣

Here is the solution: 
https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/darts/solutions/ngl4

- Went to groceries with family and went to see the doctor and realized my health is not really in good condition - self-care is super super important right now.

This is a singly linked list problem and it is considered to be a "Hard" type exercise
Completed the Element class test cases, still need to work on the List class and the Lists with multiple elements 
Also took some time to learn how to reverse a linked list 

- Learned how to reverse a singly linked list today and made sure I have fully understood the concept!!!

The List element is slightly complicated. I get stuck at the get head() method and also I think I need to make sure the input list should be reversed before setting `this.list = list` in the constructor 
Anyway, I will keep trying and solving the problem. 
Due to other priorities to work on tomorrow evening, I will continue with this exercise on Thursday!

🤔I still get kind of stuck in this problem. I think I need to break it down even smaller to work on. OR I will revisit the concept and pattern to learn how a linked list works before getting back to this problem.

🥳I am glad that I have recovered and now I am back to work on solving more problems. Hopefully, I can get through this linked list problem asap.

Completed toArray() and reverse() methods 
They are pretty straight-forward. 
I got a TypeError on the reverse() method - the solution is actually to make sure to return List{} object instead of Element{} object. 
Overall, this is a hard-type exercise, but it definitely helps me to understand how to create a Linked List using Class constructor. 

Here is my solution: https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/simple-linked-list/solutions/ngl4

- Worked on some Array problems and they are pretty hard and I have 2 problems I do not know how to solve
- It is my first time using Hashmap data structure to solve one of the algo problems on Array 
- Chatted with a Formation Fellow, Wesley, and got the chance to see his works 
- Reviewed Engineering Methods  - how to walk through an approach in the interview situation - This is considered one of the skills that require a lot of practices to be better in. 
- Overall, you did a lot today and I am really proud of you. 

Problems I still need to figure out and practice more: 
- Find the kth element start from the end of the linked list 
- merge sort 
- DFS - find max binary tree nodes sum problem -noted as incomplete 
- Review how to apply stack in DFS problems 
- (slow) find the closest distance elem from the target value 
- Practice BST. 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Keep working on Formation Tasks!! - Linked Lists + Binary Tree + Sorting
- Work on JXT and solve the Internal Server Issue problem 
- Work on DEV blog post!

Completed (11/11 test cases) the Transpose exercise
I still failed using my approach, but it was a great try and I realized I overthink the problem. 
I looked up the community solution online an there are a lot of approaches on this problem. I found one of them to be slightly easier to understand than the others. 
I have used this programmer's approach and went through their code line by line to make sure I have fully understand what is going on. 
Using map() method for this problem is definitely eye-opening to me. 
Definitely will revist this problem again to see if I can try other approaches!

Practiced Perfect Numbers on Exercism (JavaScript)
Completed so far: 65 (done) / Total: 139 

#100DaysOfCode #JavaScript #womenintech #Exercism 

(more in comment)

Completed the Perfect Numbers passing all test cases 
The function is to determine if the input number is a perfect (sum === num), abundant (sum > num), deficient (sum < num) number. 
sum = (all the num that are divisors of the input number)
ie, input num = 6 -> sum = 1 + 2 + 3 (these 3 numbers are divisors of 6 and will have no remainder when 6 is dividing with them)

Here is my solution: https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/perfect-numbers/solutions/ngl4


**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Work on documentation on my learnings in the 30 Core Algos in DEV and Github!! 

Others: 
- Work on JXT and solve the Internal Server Issue problem 
- Work on DEV blog post! 


#### 17 March 2022

**Reflection**: 
- Working on the Linked List documentation in DEV.to (Basics & Core Algos overview with the grouping)
- Finished my full time works at around 8.30 pm today. Took some rest and spend some times on the basic algos documentation!! 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Work on documentation on my learnings in the 30 Core Algos in DEV and Github!! 

Others: 
- Work on JXT and solve the Internal Server Issue problem 
- Work on DEV blog post! 


#### 18 March 2022

**Reflection**: 
- Continued to work on the documentation and found I took too long to document on DEV. It would be faster to do all the coding explanation in Github repo and then use the DEV blog to share or to go through mainly the overview of all the core algos. This would be faster and hopefully, I can try to complete it by tomorrow. 
- It would be best to share with others who are learning to see what I can include more in the documentation

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Complete all the formation tasks!
- Work on documentation on my learnings in the 30 Core Algos in DEV and Github!! 

Others: 
- Work on JXT and solve the Internal Server Issue problem 
- Work on DEV blog post! 

#### 19 March 2022

**Reflection**: 
- Continued to practice on basic algos even though I have already passed Algo Blitz ~ still pretty slow at selection sort and insertion sort 
- Continued to work on documentation ~ did not get through much 
- Spend a great amount of time with my famly and ate at the restaurant for the first time after 2 and a half years!! 

**Plan For Tomorrow**:
- Complete all the formation tasks!
- Work on documentation on my learnings in the 30 Core Algos in DEV and Github!!

## Monthly Reflection Feb-March 2022
It has been a while since I wrote up a reflection in this progress tracker. A lot of things have come and go and I think it is really great to know what to let go and what to keep and move with it. So in February, I started my journey in Formation, this has been definitely a life-changing experience for me so far. It is definitely really intense fellowship program, but I get a lot of values in life out of it. Being able to be part of the Formation community opens up more perspectives on the technical interview traning aspect. It helps to push me forward to become better in understanding and solving engineering problems. I find even the easy problems are just as hard as they are. I do have a hard time getting through some of them. I still need a lot a lot a lot of practice to be more prepared for an actual interview. 

**What I have done well these two months:** 
- Passed the first round Algo Blitz assessment at Formation (got one of the assessment completed within 30 mins) ~ I was really happy about my performance!! 
- Doing well at my full time job and keeping up with high quality performance && Being able to support all my family expenses and find ways to help with the difficult financial situations
- Being optimistic whenever facing all the difficult challenges in work, life, and study. And being able to take actions to resolve these challenges is what I feel really proud of for this month. 
- Advocated for your own documentation on your learnings at Formation to get the opportunity to document all the things I have learned at Formation and put them in DEV blog post and Github repo.
    - Got approval from Formation to do the documentation!!! 
- Attended a lot of Algo Workout sessions and learned from other mentors - realized my weakness when facing difficult challenges or challenges that I have not seen before: common one is how to do a reduce(), some(), split(), slice(), etc. Javascript methods from scratch!!! This is not as easy as I thought and I definitely need a lot of practices in being used to being in an uncomfortable situation (technical interview)

**What I need to work on to improve:**
- Skin care and health care - being able to take good care of my skin and my health is really important for self-esteem and for healthy body -> in order to perform well in challenging situation like technical interview or anything else in life 
- Twitter post - feel like it is getting inconsistent with the post on #100daysofcode - it is definitely really hard to keep up with the challenge while performing well at Formation (with a new hashtag #formationProgress). So I think it is best to work on documenting what I have done on the day. If it is on Exercism, then I will update the #100DaysOfCode post. If not, it is okay to just keep up with the daily post on my progress and to make sure I can complete what I find more important as of now. 
- Sleep - I really have to be able to get at least 8 hrs of sleep and it is definitely really challenging. I think going to bed early - slightly early like around 10. Aiming for that. This would help. 
- Exercise and Sunlight - I really need to re-start my exercise routine and get more sunlight each day to make sure my body feels its best and so I could perform well in my learnings at Formation!! 
- Social Network - being able connect and get to know more people at Formation!! Try to aim for at least 1 each week!!
